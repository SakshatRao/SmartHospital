# SmartHospital

Major Project for the year 2020-21 under Electronics & Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology Karnataka, guided by Dr. M.S. Bhat

## Brief Description

---

Creating an embedded system ecosystem for hospitals that can facilitate better service to patients and doctors and ultimately improve Quality of Care (QoC). Trying to develop a ‘Smart Hospital’ environment by applying Internet of Things (IoT) in a hospital-specific workplace. Demonstrating how embedded systems can assist doctors, comfort patients and make diagnosis, prognosis & treatment more efficient.

## Motivation

---

- The advancement of IoT systems in almost all sectors has created a lot of smart environments (smart agriculture, smart cars, smart factories, etc.) which make use of technology to perform simple and sometimes even complex human-like tasks
- The healthcare sector’s hesitance to adopt newer technology is slowly disappearing since IoT has been demonstrated to immensely help healthcare workers in performing time-critical tasks in an efficient and secure manner

## Expected Outcome

---

A prototype of a Hospital Operation Management System that demonstrates how different tasks in a hospital set-up can not only be performed by embedded systems but also be integrated into a single ecosystem. It will include hardware implementations of different embedded systems, whose functioning will be overseen by a central server.

## Features Implemented

---

- Web Server
- Dashboards
- Continuous Remote Patient Health Monitoring Device
- Smart Sanitizers
- Smart Headgears
- Electronic Health Records
